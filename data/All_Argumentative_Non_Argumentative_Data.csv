307:13;Atom_1159;Atom seems like it continues to tie the idea of splits, etc to the idea of buffers;Claim
307:14;Atom_1159;whether it's an inability to manage panes when there are no open buffers, an inability to unsplit panes, or the fact that a pane disappears when its last buffer is closed.;Premise

310:11;Atom_3064;Fixed by #3409 thanks;Claim
310:12;Atom_3064;"Awesome. Thanks for picking this up, @syndbg!";Non-Argument
310:14;Atom_3064;"""Open Folder"" is usually what I want on linux,";Claim
310:15;Atom_3064;The shortcut keymapping can actually be configured via the `~/.atom/keymap.cson` and if you do add an (redundant) entry, it will make the shortcut appear in the menu:;Claim
310:16;Atom_3064;I'd be up for changing `ctrl-shift-O` to be the actual Open Folder command, do you know any other apps that follow this behavior for opening files vs. folders?;Claim
310:17;Atom_3064;I think `Ctrl` is a good leading modifier key.;Claim
310:18;Atom_3064;`O` seems intuitive;Claim
310:19;Atom_3064;the obvious choice would be `Alt`: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd> to open a folder.;Claim
310:20;Atom_3064;As far as I can see, there is no such binding in Atom or the bundled packages.;Claim
310:21;Atom_3064;I do also advocate for changing the `Ctrl-Shift-O` keybinding: While on Apple keyboards the `Alt` and `Cmd` keys are swapped, making them almost equivalently prominent, on PC keyboards `Ctrl` and `Shift` are considerably nearer together than `Ctrl` and `Alt`, making it harder to press them at the same time.;Claim
310:22;Atom_3064;"This means that the keybinding to open an (Atom or Atom package) developer feature would be more prominent than an end user (not necessarily a developer) feature. I think at that point developer friendliness is overdone.Here are some examples of `Ctrl+Shift` in end user functionality:- In many editors with history support";Claim
310:23;Atom_3064;"`Ctrl+O` opens a file while `Ctrl+Alt+O` opens the folder the currently opened files is stored in. In Brackets, `Ctrl-Alt-O` opens the QuickOpen (like Atom's FuzzyFinder), which is probably more frequently used and displaced opening the folder of the current file.Overall `Ctrl-Shift-O` seems to be an unusual key binding for opening something";Claim
310:24;Atom_3064;. I could imagine that the cause for this is that few programs actually have a concept of a folder/directory _and also_ a concept of a file. Many text editors only know single files and IDEs usually have a concept of a project which leads to not having a concept of a file without a project anymore. For example, Eclipse can not even open a file without a project, for sublime every opened file is implicitely an opened project.;Claim
310:25;Atom_3064;However we shouldn't think as other text editors. If it's useful and users create that keybind anyway, then it should be a keybind by default.;Claim
310:26;Atom_3064;I think `ctrl-shift-o` should open a folder, `open-dev` is an advanced feature and we've tried in the past to not reserve common keybindings for advanced features.;Claim
310:27;Atom_3064;Running `open-dev` was really common in the early days of Atom development;Claim
310:28;Atom_3064;But for the most part, people aren't doing this, except when developing packages or core, in which case using `ctrl-alt-o` on Linux to open a dev window is just as easy I believe, and of course these can always be remapped locally.;Claim
310:29;Atom_3064;`ctrl-shift-O` is currently bound to `application:open-dev` on Linux, so although it prompts for a folder, it isn't the standard Open Folder action, it opens a new window in dev mode to the selected folder. Dev mode windows are primarily used for developing packages or Atom core;Claim
310:30;Atom_3064;since it loads the CoffeeScript code from the repository instead of the JavaScript from the built app.;Premise
310:31;Atom_3064;Since opening a folder is a command to be executed;Premise
310:32;Atom_3064;because opening a file or a folder in dev mode use the same character;Premise
310:33;Atom_3064;Since `Shift` is used by `application:open-dev` by defaul;Premise
310:34;Atom_3064;"I see this going two ways:A) We decide the keybind based on C# IDEs - `ctrl-shift-o`B) We create a poll with choices `ctrl-shift-o`, `ctrl-alt-o` or `suggestion` and users vote.";Premise
310:35;Atom_3064;since it was the only way to have a stable window and bleeding edge window so you could use atom while developing atom.;Premise

310:37;Atom_3064;as it's the default on OS/X. I can't seem to find a possibility to add a shortcut for this on linux. It doesn't appear in the keybindings menu, and the menu item for it in the file menu is blank, indicating no shortcut.;Premise
310:38;Atom_3064;It's not displayed;Claim

If you do shift+up then cmd+l, the beginning of the first line is selected, but not the end of the last line. So, what seems to be going on is that cmd+l is adding the line containing the cursor to the selection, instead of adding all lines containing selected text to the selection.Weirdly, if you click and drag from midway through a line to midway through the line above then cmd+l, it selects all of the upper line but deselects the lower line entirely.";Claim

323:5;Atom_10063;"Leave the ""x"" where it is (on the right-hand side), but use Chrome's approach of keeping the tab size constant until the user moves the mouse out of the tab region.

327:28;Atom_11448;looking at that package, it seems that it removes the close-icon completely, which also doubles as the modified icon. I tried copying the styles without installing the package and it seems to confirm my suspicions.;Claim
327:29;Atom_11448;Modified icons shown by default. Close icon only visible on hover in active tab. Clicking in the close icon area on other tabs only changes to that tab;Claim
327:30;Atom_11448;The downside is modified icons are also hidden on hover if the tab is not active. The close action is probably a script command tied to div.close-icon, ;Claim

327:45;Atom_11448;The close button (box? what do you call it?) actually has an even bigger active area than it looks like, so anywhere towards the right side of the text ends up closing the tab;Claim

441:11;Jupyter_Lab_227;"Improve notebook toolbar design## Summary- Style cell type and kernel dropdowns- Clean up vertical height and line-height- Possibly add separators## Original commentWe (@spoorthyv @charnpreetsingh185 @katiewhite360) have created a mockup of the updated notebook toolbar and would like some feedback.We replaced the icons with google's material icons because not only are they more visually appealing, but they are also more intuitive than some of the current icons.We also added sections to the toolbar to add visual separation between the icons. We placed run kernel, interrupt kernel, and restart kernel in one section. Cut cells, copy cells, and paste cells are placed in another section.We moved the kernel functions (run kernel, intterupt kernel, etc.) to after the add new cell icon because they will be used more often than the cut, copy, paste icons. We placed them closer to the left because of their higher importance.During our user tests of we noticed that when multiple users would try to change kernels, they would click the top right kernel label in the toolbar multiple times because they thought it was a dropdown. We decided to change it to actually be a dropdown where you can change kernels.We also want to add an indicator of when the file has been saved";Claim
441:12;Jupyter_Lab_227;"so there is some kind of reaction when the save button is clicked. We placed that indicator after the ""Markdown"" dropdown.";Premise

443:15;Jupyter_Lab_268;The `(1)` just means it's the first console you have open. Right now, the version of phosphor we are using doesn't have tooltips, but the mono repo version will, so we can add a more helpful tooltip.;Premise

444:6;Jupyter_Lab_303;as this is a difference in behavior with the old notebook:;Premise
444:7;Jupyter_Lab_303;The reasoning being that split/merge should be inverse functions, and that merge does append a newline.;Claim
445:3;Jupyter_Lab_447;(1) Some ideas: perhaps even a temporary indication, such as the command entry in the command palette blinking once or twice when executed, would help provide visual feedback that a command was executed. And then once the command is executed, deselect the command, but leave the filter left in place and selected, as is currently done.;Claim
445:4;Jupyter_Lab_447; `Cmd+Shift+P` always opening, and `Esc` closing when the palette is focused.;Non-Argument
445:6;Jupyter_Lab_447;"I think this can be closed.";Claim
445:7;Jupyter_Lab_447;"This was not addressed, but I'll open another issue for it.";Non-Argument
445:8;Jupyter_Lab_447;Right now the command palette has some awkward interactions:;Claim
445:9;Jupyter_Lab_447;"When you open the CP with Command+Shift+P, it focuses the search field and you can type and press enter to run the command. But there is no visual indication the command was run. The search field is still populated/filtered and the original selected item is still selected. Running a command should completely reset the search field and selection.- After you run a command, you can't keep working on your previous activity as the CP is still focused. We should focus the previous activity.- If you ran a command, go back to your activity and they try to run another command, the CP collapses. This makes it impossible to run multiple commands in a row. Command+Shift+P should always _open_ (not toggle) the CP.";Premise
445:10;Jupyter_Lab_447;I have no strong opinion on this either way.;Claim
445:11;Jupyter_Lab_447;I think the best course of action is to allow the command to decide what should get focus.;Claim
445:12;Jupyter_Lab_447;Some of us talked about this briefly as Scipy and seemd to agree `Cmd+Shift+P` should always open the command palette instead of toggle it;Claim
445:13;Jupyter_Lab_447;And `Esc` should probably close it.;Claim
445:14;Jupyter_Lab_447;The input field is focused and selected _before_ the command is run. So if the command execution sets focus to something, that thing will remain focused. In general, the command palette has no way of knowing what was previously focused;Premise
445:15;Jupyter_Lab_447;What you describe _used_ to be the behavior;Claim
445:16;Jupyter_Lab_447;We opted with the current behavior as this is what sublime does (except that sublime closes the palette on each command execution).;Premise
445:18;Jupyter_Lab_447;this was a bad idea.;Claim
445:19;Jupyter_Lab_447;The command itself should focus if desired, but the command palette wouldn't know where to focus.;Claim

In order for that to work well, we need the parts of jupyerlab that can be themed to be expressed as CSS variables. It sounds like you found a few more bits that need to be expressed as variables?

452:17;Jupyter_Lab_1084;I find looking at white screen all days strains my eyes, particularly when I switching from dark themed windows (terminal, text editor, etc.) to white themed ones.  I like that jupyterlab provides the option to change the theme from the **Editor > Theme** menu ;Premise
452:19;Jupyter_Lab_1084;it would be even better if this changed the theme of all jupyterlab windows.;Claim
452:20;Jupyter_Lab_1084;interactive plot would be simpler (and look fantastic with a dark theme!);Claim
452:21;Jupyter_Lab_1084;Add option to change application theme;Claim
452:22;Jupyter_Lab_1084;It would be nice to add a menu option for this.;Claim
452:23;Jupyter_Lab_1084;In my opinion, only a few best themes should only available (vs lots of themes).;Claim
452:24;Jupyter_Lab_1084;It's very distracting for general users to choose from sea of selections.;Premise
452:25;Jupyter_Lab_1084;I think that this is a great idea.;Claim

452:33;Jupyter_Lab_1084;This wouldn't change the editor themes - I think that would probably need some more work.;Claim
452:34;Jupyter_Lab_1084;Basically, I see a theme switching plugin as (1) providing a way to add and remove a style tag on a page with a given set of CSS variable settings, (2) a way for plugins to register new themes (which basically would be a chunk of CSS variable setting code to add in a style tag), and (3) adding say a top-level menu item that lists themes and lets you choose another one.;Premise
452:35;Jupyter_Lab_1084;Perhaps @blink1073 has thought about how we might be able to change the editor themes;Claim

454:20;Jupyter_Lab_1308;I am fine with the feature parity version of this being a text editor, ;Claim
454:21;Jupyter_Lab_1308;So for full feature parity notebook metadata and cell level metadata should probably be treated separately.;Claim
454:22;Jupyter_Lab_1308;even if there is a metadata editor in the cell toolbar (for which I'm +1), it'd probably be good to have an additional/separate UI for editing the *notebook*'s metadata that doesn't appear in the L side *cell* toolbar, even if it means just having a L side *notebook* toolbar if only to avoid confusion.;Claim
454:23;Jupyter_Lab_1308;that seems a bit of a fraught solution;Claim
454:24;Jupyter_Lab_1308;The other paradigm I could imagine would be that the notebook metadata is what is accessible when no cells are selected;Claim
454:25;Jupyter_Lab_1308;"So for full feature parity notebook metadata and cell level metadata should probably be treated separately.In the classic notebook:* notebook level metadata are editable from the ""Edit ?

461:20;Jupyter_Lab_2277;We may want to think about this for the beta. Would need some design work from @cameronoelsen;Claim
461:21;Jupyter_Lab_2277;My initial thought is to put the tag UI into the cell tools side panel with the other cell metadata related things;Claim
461:23;Jupyter_Lab_2277;Closing this;Claim
461:24;Jupyter_Lab_2277;as the functionality is being worked on in an extension;Premise
461:25;Jupyter_Lab_2277;I think adding this to jupyterlab proper should be reconsidered (or at least installation simplified to `pip <some-extension>`).;Claim
461:26;Jupyter_Lab_2277;`jupyterlab-celltags` is not really a viable alternative at this point.;Claim
461:27;Jupyter_Lab_2277;This requires a quite substantial overhead compared a normal pip install (and in my case, I work in a controlled environment where I have pip+PYPI available, but not npm).;Claim
461:28;Jupyter_Lab_2277;I came here;Claim
461:29;Jupyter_Lab_2277;as I'm surprised there are no tags in JupyterLab, which are required by the papermill tool.;Premise
461:30;Jupyter_Lab_2277;in this situation, the only thing which comes to my mind is catching the NameError exception;Claim
461:31;Jupyter_Lab_2277;as papermill adds parameter definitions into a first cell of a notebook;Premise
461:32;Jupyter_Lab_2277;Yeah, it works great too!;Claim
461:33;Jupyter_Lab_2277;! For folks using things like papermill or really depending on tags, we should make this more user friendly that editing a json structure;Claim
461:34;Jupyter_Lab_2277;I'm available to create some documentation on how to do this without an extension. (.i.e edit metadata to act as a tag.);Claim

462:5;Jupyter_Lab_2346;I notice that the behavior of the up arrow between cells in a notebook puts the cursor at the beginning of the cell that is moved to.;Non-Argument
462:6;Jupyter_Lab_2346;Pressing the up arrow in console should put the cursor at the end of the previous command;Claim
462:7;Jupyter_Lab_2346;I think the cursor should be placed at the end of the line, just like the qt console.;Claim
462:8;Jupyter_Lab_2346;Currently (`0.23.1`) when I press up arrow in a console, the previous command shows up, but the cursor remains on the beginning of the line;Premise
462:9;Jupyter_Lab_2346;It should probably go up to the previous line;Claim
462:10;Jupyter_Lab_2346;But then you can't go back through history quickly by just hitting up. I think that is why we had it go to the beginning as then you can press up again and keep going in the history. Further clarification would help us figure out the right behavior.;Premise
462:11;Jupyter_Lab_2346;I have a slight preference for option two;Claim
462:12;Jupyter_Lab_2346;since it allows both for easy editing of previous one-liners and for quick scrolling through history;Premise
462:13;Jupyter_Lab_2346;I agree.;Claim
462:14;Jupyter_Lab_2346;"I just tested this with QT console, and I found its behavior (pressing up goes to the end of the first line of the previous command (let's say this is the command `-1`) for both single- and multi-line commands) preferable.Also, If you press up one more time (to command `-2`) and then press down, then qtconsole puts the cursor at the _end_ of the last line of the command `-1` as well, making it easy to scroll back.";Premise

463:10;Jupyter_Lab_2383;Some activities such as the notebook have a toolbar that blends into the tab visually. Other activities don't have the toolbar, which causes an abrupt transition between the tab and the scrolling content below.;Claim

471:22;Jupyter_Lab_3233;I know we're looking at the concept of 'hiding' versus 'collapsing' with regard to cells.;Claim
471:23;Jupyter_Lab_3233;This context comes up from the new new controls associated with the ToC extension.;Claim
471:24;Jupyter_Lab_3233;I think #1 has the least implications for future design decisions;Claim
471:25;Jupyter_Lab_3233;I think we should move forward with skipping collapsed cells when scrolling with the keyboard for now.;Claim
471:26;Jupyter_Lab_3233;We can always address this further if that's causing trouble.;Claim
471:27;Jupyter_Lab_3233;it should focus on cell [6] with the content `B` and when I type after hitting down, it should end up in that cell.;Claim

473:2;Jupyter_Lab_3464;Add and use CSS variables for box shadows/elevation;Claim
473:3;Jupyter_Lab_3464;It would really help to have CSS variables for different elevations of box shadow, for both light and dark theme. Marking as beta, but this can land during the rc cycle.;Claim
473:4;Jupyter_Lab_3464;Right now all of our box shadows are hard coded. We are mostly trying to use the Material Design elevation idea for our box shadows.;Premise

475:5;Jupyter_Lab_3681;We want a way to be able to detect themes/theme changes inside extensions.;Claim
475:6;Jupyter_Lab_3681;"For example, an extensions that adds toolbar icons should be able to switch color between light/dark modes (just like the existing buttons do).proposed short term change is to add .light/.dark classes to the root app node to distinguish between themes, so extensions can pick up the distinction in their own css.proposed long term change is to add theme changed events, including light/dark distinctions, so extensions can do things like invert their colors (e.g. a charting extension can invert when theme changes from light to dark)";Premise

480:5;Jupyter_Lab_4211;Also, for a good implementation the taskLists would need to support editing the markdown itself - i.e. the markdown cells would be editable by clicking on the rendered text's checkbox. Which will be custom for jupyterlab.;Premise

507:17;Jupyter_Lab_6768;The new find/replace functionality looks nice, but I noticed that, as far as I can tell, I can't search the output of a cell.;Claim
507:18;Jupyter_Lab_6768;I expect the search to find two instances, the instance in the code cell and the instance in the output cell;Claim
507:19;Jupyter_Lab_6768;In principle it would seem nice if it was possible to search e.g. the text in a figure as well.;Claim
507:20;Jupyter_Lab_6768;Perhaps you could select the scope of the search with an additional combo box in the find tool, or with some check boxes.;Claim
507:21;Jupyter_Lab_6768;your solution worked, but clicking is quite cumbersome;Claim
507:22;Jupyter_Lab_6768;maybe there should be a way to map browser search to Ctrl+F and custom search to something else;Claim
507:23;Jupyter_Lab_6768;An alternative to *clicking* the top menu bar is to open up the command pallet (Ctrl+Shift+C) and then Ctrl+F;Claim
507:24;Jupyter_Lab_6768;This seems to work;Claim
507:25;Jupyter_Lab_6768;Alternatively, @jasongrout's idea of changing the key bindings is the best one;Claim
507:26;Jupyter_Lab_6768;"What do people think about making ctrl-f have an option to choose where to search (input, output)? If not, would people object to using @raulf2012 suggestion:1. If you are in a cell, ctrl-f just searches that cell2. If you are not in a cell, ctrl-f uses the browsers search3. If you are not in a cell, ctrl-shift-f uses the find in code search";Non-Argument
507:27;Jupyter_Lab_6768;Using the same convention we have for context menus (shift-right-click for default browser), perhaps ctrl-shift-f always invokes browser search;Claim
507:28;Jupyter_Lab_6768;I think I would prefer to have a keyboard shortcut consistently invoke the same search.;Claim
507:29;Jupyter_Lab_6768;Similar to the regexp option today, I imagine there would be options for searching in all, input, or output. Obviously, replace won't work for output;Claim
507:30;Jupyter_Lab_6768;Searching stdout and stderr would be much easier;Claim
507:31;Jupyter_Lab_6768;, since we know those are text.;Premise
507:32;Jupyter_Lab_6768;Searching all output is significantly harder than searching input,;Claim
507:33;Jupyter_Lab_6768;since we can have arbitrary renderers rendering outputs, and who knows what html or graphics they might be putting on the page.;Premise
507:34;Jupyter_Lab_6768;I quickly tried something [based on this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/10730777/3745694) and it seems to mostly work.;Claim
507:35;Jupyter_Lab_6768;In my experience, working directly with the rendered DOM is really difficult when you have all sorts of other frameworks messing with it (React and Phosphor).;Claim
507:36;Jupyter_Lab_6768;I tried to do something like this in the classic notebook, finding the nodes containing matches, inserting a `span` around the match, applying a class to the `span`, and keeping track of them so that I could clean up later.;Claim
507:37;Jupyter_Lab_6768;I do think this could be a good place to start for most basic output types, especially those that aren't interactive and especially if you limit this sort of DOM search to the outputs.  I haven't tried anything like this yet in JupyterLab with the new documentsearch framework,;Claim
507:38;Jupyter_Lab_6768;I'm not sure what sort of model-like information might be available about cell output;Claim
507:39;Jupyter_Lab_6768;This is the approach that I initially envisioned taking once we got around to cell outputs, maybe due to some bitter memories of DOM-based search on the classic notebook;Claim
507:40;Jupyter_Lab_6768;This may be hard.;Claim
507:41;Jupyter_Lab_6768;I believe its at least worth trying to do something here - even if we can't solve every case.;Claim
507:42;Jupyter_Lab_6768;it will hurt novice users.;Claim
507:43;Jupyter_Lab_6768;"From a UX POV only having search on inputs and not outputs feels like a poor choice. While we can escape to the built in search for the browser one as above, but that is something only advanced users will do;";Premise
507:44;Jupyter_Lab_6768;I agree, it'll likely be difficult.  I don't know enough about how outputs are rendered to know where in that process this sort of logic might belong, but I think having something that works *with* the rendering step rather than on top of it or after the fact might be more robust and flexible for the myriad different output types that exist now and in the future;Claim
507:45;Jupyter_Lab_6768;If search was built directly into how things are rendered, it'd make it easier to integrate different forms of output in the future.;Claim
507:46;Jupyter_Lab_6768;And yeah I totally agree, searching only inputs is not ideal.  We absolutely do want to search the outputs.;Claim
507:47;Jupyter_Lab_6768;The reason we decided to only search inputs to start;Claim
507:48;Jupyter_Lab_6768;because searching inputs was a much more tractable problem.  CodeMirror already has some searching facilities built in, all we needed was a bit of logic to orchestrate it.  We wanted to get some form of searching working before 1.0 that would allow for nicer features than what you'd get from the browser, like regex matching and search & replace.;Premise
507:49;Jupyter_Lab_6768;We kind of punted on searching the outputs;Claim
507:50;Jupyter_Lab_6768;because it's significantly more difficult for the reasons I mentioned above.;Premise
507:51;Jupyter_Lab_6768;I haven't had time since then to take a swing at output search and I'm not sure I'll have much time in the near future;Claim
507:52;Jupyter_Lab_6768;f you think you've got an approach you'd like to try, please go for it!  I'd also be happy to talk with you more about the documentsearch package and the approach we've taken for search so far if you'd like.co;Claim
507:54;Jupyter_Lab_6768;I agree that we should allow renders to be allowed to have some ability to implement search. ;Claim
507:55;Jupyter_Lab_6768;A good example if a table with virtual rendering for data. The table may want to implement search to include all cells within it.;Premise
507:56;Jupyter_Lab_6768;Still, by default, it would be good to implement anything that searched the DOM for text.;Claim
507:57;Jupyter_Lab_6768;Even if something like: `<span class='bar'>hello </span> world` cannot find `hello world`, having some search text would be a big step forward.;Claim
507:58;Jupyter_Lab_6768;Personally I think this issue is critical enough that we should consider disabling the Jupyterlab-specific search by default;Claim
507:59;Jupyter_Lab_6768;"that is, assigning it to a different shortcut or only to some kind of toolbar button, not to Ctrl-F, and making the user change the config to ""opt in"" to assigning it to Ctrl-F, rather than the reverse.  The ability to search the entire page is a basic function of a web browser, and having to use any workaround whatsoever to get past Jupyterlab's grabbing of that shortcut is a major hit to productivity when using it";Premise
507:60;Jupyter_Lab_6768;It will also confuse new users;Claim
507:61;Jupyter_Lab_6768;because it fails silently (i.e., if you search for something in the output you just get no results, and maybe think there are none, without realizing it's not searching the output at all).;Premise

508:9;Jupyter_Lab_6876;since its been a few months since that guy said anything;Premise
508:10;Jupyter_Lab_6876;I can't seem to find an extension API for adding a new section to the running sidebar, is there one? If not can this be a feature request to add one?;Claim
508:11;Jupyter_Lab_6876;I'm currently doing some work on https://github.com/chaoleili/jupyterlab_tensorboard and one thing that we want to add is a list of running tensorboard sessions to the running sidebar. Currently, the hack to make this work is to add a new tab the the sidebar just for managing tensorboards. This is kind of ugly and redundant when there is already a panel for it.

512:9;Jupyter_Lab_7643;It would be nice for the behavior to be coherent for the different cases.;Claim
512:10;Jupyter_Lab_7643;It would actually be very useful to have this signal emitted when the number of widgets in the tracker goes down to 0 (and `currentWidget` becomes `null`);Claim
512:11;Jupyter_Lab_7643;"This is something that is also relevant to other third-party extensions that rely on the `tracker.currentChanged` signal.After some investigation it looks like the `pool.current` is set to `null` here:https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/blob/6461d0bb6e51b44a533e96177de85f769995f2c8/packages/apputils/src/widgettracker.ts#L130But in the setter since `obj` is `null`, the `currentChanged` signal will not be emitted:https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/blob/6461d0bb6e51b44a533e96177de85f769995f2c8/packages/coreutils/src/restorablepool.ts#L63-L66";Premise
512:12;Jupyter_Lab_7643;I think that is really important (some people may use the currentWidget signal to switch things off of the current widget, and they won't know when that widget goes away if the signal is not emitted when the widget becomes null);Claim

513:2;Jupyter_Lab_7671;Code editor refresh is brittle;Claim
513:3;Jupyter_Lab_7671;The logic around when to refresh the code editor is brittle.  I tested this by opening the same set of static notebook contents in three main area widgets.  The last one populated successfully shows its input areas, but the other two did not.  I have a fix coming.;Claim
514:8;Jupyter_Lab_7983;I can imagine it might help users to see which completions they're using more often for instance;Claim
514:9;Jupyter_Lab_7983;In short, I like the idea of giving users more control over their actions, but I don't like cluttering the screen whenever we can avoid it.;Claim
514:10;Jupyter_Lab_7983;That is correct;Claim
514:11;Jupyter_Lab_7983;A JupyterLab user would be able to get completions from both the LSP server and Kite.;Premise
514:12;Jupyter_Lab_7983;In this setup, it’s extremely likely that the two providers will send the same completions to the completions list. Without visual differentiation and de-duping, this could give off the impression that completions are buggy.;Claim
514:13;Jupyter_Lab_7983;Even with de-duping, adding a visual indicator would give users more insight into the value add of their chosen extensions. If all completions looked the same, there’s no way for a user to know a given extension moved the needle, or that the extension is actually working.;Claim
514:14;Jupyter_Lab_7983;I believe this is how VScode does it as well;Claim
514:15;Jupyter_Lab_7983;There may be some instances where one provider is able to surface completions while the other is not. Enabling both to run at the same time allows the best of both worlds.;Claim
514:16;Jupyter_Lab_7983;In VSCode, if a user has the MS Python extension and Kite, both are used to generate completions as well;Claim

530:33;VsCode_3690;I think we can use it.;Claim
530:34;VsCode_3690;since VS Code is only ever running in a Chrome environment;Premise
530:35;VsCode_3690;I think this CSS rule is not needed;Claim
530:37;VsCode_3690;you're right that this is not an issue for Chrome.  It's only an issue in the stand-alone editor when running on IE and Edge.;Premise
530:38;VsCode_3690;So anything that is shared code with the stand-alone editor must use one of the techniques above or else all things displayed via `background-image` will be removed in high contrast mode on Windows. ;Claim
530:39;VsCode_3690;"it's a ""sledgehammer approach"" to stop IE and Edge to mess with our styles.";Claim
530:40;VsCode_3690; Otherwise, Monaco editor will stand out like an ugly bright iframe anywhere it's used, as IE and Edge will convert the whole page to be high-contrasty except for things nested under `.monaco-editor`.;Premise
530:43;VsCode_3690;I think we can use a get CSS function;Claim
530:44;VsCode_3690; This would benefit both web-embedded Monaco and in VS Code visually and accessibility-wise.;Premise
530:46;VsCode_3690;I'll put this on the June Milestone.;Claim
530:47;VsCode_3690;- this is the task I'll work on once your change is in Master.;Premise
530:48;VsCode_3690;In https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/9023 I have a change ready that just uses the dark-theme image when we are in hc-black theme. I noticed that the standalone editor already adopted this.;Claim
530:49;VsCode_3690;we should add the `-ms-high-contrast-adjust: none` there.;Claim
530:50;VsCode_3690;so the current version that is out is likely not working so well with HC mode on in Windows. However, I am not sure if this was reported already.;Claim
530:51;VsCode_3690;note that for the release of the standalone editor, Alex was already removing all HC hacks,;Premise
530:52;VsCode_3690;If we do this, we should use JavaScript (or some other means, maybe we already are) to detect if Windows is in high-contrast mode and automatically apply the high-contrast base classes `.hc-dark`.;Claim
530:53;VsCode_3690;I'd love to have auto-recognition of high-contrast theme.;Claim
530:54;VsCode_3690;If so, we should default to the high-contrast theme;Claim

530:58;VsCode_3690;PR merged.;Claim
530:59;VsCode_3690;The automatic switching of the editor to the `hc-black` and the automatic detection of the high contrast mode in IE/Edge will be tracked in #10576;Premise
530:60;VsCode_3690;Make high-contrast mode less hacky for Monaco editor in IE and Edge;Claim
530:61;VsCode_3690;"In our **high contrast theme** we are using clever CSS that sidesteps around style overrides IE and Edge do when Windows is in High Contrast Mode.Fortunately, there's a single rule we can use in CSS now to stop IE 10+ and Edge from trying to modify our styles.`-ms-high-contrast-adjust: none`It overrides the browsers' default behavior to modify the styles to be more high-contrasty.";Premise
530:62;VsCode_3690;This means we can stop using hacks like `::after` and `::before`  elements to insert icons as non-background images (which would otherwise not be displayed as background images).;Claim
530:63;VsCode_3690;It could really break the Monaco editor in Edge or IE on windows if high-contrast mode is enabled,;Claim

537:7;VsCode_14638;"If you choose ""Move it to recyclebin"", it will fail";Claim
537:8;VsCode_14638;because there is no recyclebin for a USB Disk.;Premise
537:9;VsCode_14638;Add an option `disableRecycleBin` in file `.vscode/settings.json`,;Claim
537:10;VsCode_14638;so that we can tell the VSCode not to use recyclebin for a specific project/folder.;Premise
537:11;VsCode_14638;A setting might be the worse user experience;Claim
537:12;VsCode_14638;Maybe we could detect if the recycle bin is supported before trying to use it;Claim
537:13;VsCode_14638;This would require API in Electron though.;Claim
537:14;VsCode_14638;As a workaround we added support in 1.6.x release to bypass the trash if you press and hold the shift key while invoking the delete. See;Premise
537:15;VsCode_14638;I would add, that I personally view the recycle bin to be an OS feature, not something dependent on the type of drive where I delete;Claim
537:16;VsCode_14638;it seems either this behavior has regressed or #1646 wasn't actually a dupe as I'm hitting this issue with a 100% repro rate.;Claim
537:17;VsCode_14638;The behavior described in this issue also repros if the recycling bin is outright disabled;Claim
537:18;VsCode_14638;This was previously reported in #1646, but that issue was considered a dupe and was closed;Claim
537:19;VsCode_14638;Now to inject my opinion, I would absolutely expect any app running on Windows to respect the configuration of the underlying OS.;Claim
537:20;VsCode_14638;I'm not sure what the reasoning is for VSCode to have special handling for the actual deletion of files and why it can't let the OS handle it;Claim
537:21;VsCode_14638;Admittedly, this particular bug is very small and the workarounds are quick;Claim
537:22;VsCode_14638;I'd prefer not to fight muscle memory to use a different key combo every time I want to delete a file.;Claim
537:23;VsCode_14638;I would be very much in favor of a setting to toggle the recycling bin off.;Claim
537:24;VsCode_14638;From a user experience perspective, it may still be a workaround;Claim
537:25;VsCode_14638;I would only have to apply once and therefore I would consider this to be a preferable workaround compared to using shift-delete;Claim
537:27;VsCode_14638;when using a remote file system such as NFS;Premise
537:28;VsCode_14638;this happens 100% of the time;Claim

537:36;VsCode_14638;I can't speak for others and I suspect I'm not in a majority, but I feel like a setting for that would be warranted regardless of whether the recycle bin exists (or is enabled) or not.;Claim
537:37;VsCode_14638;I just *want* to permanently delete by default, without disabling the recycle bin system-wide.;Premise
537:38;VsCode_14638;It's bad enough (for me);Claim

556:22;VsCode_43645;" I've been playing with this a bit over the last couple of day -- very cool. Though I noticed that the activity title is used in the form of `container.title: view.name` which feels strange when there is only 1 view contributed. Maybe the the view name can only be tacked on when there is more than 1?Also if there are no views added into an activity, should it show in the sidebar? For example, let's say I have a conditional view (`when` clause) that associated with an activity.

556:29;VsCode_43645;Extension can group the views they would like to have under single viewlet. This will work well with azure views.;Claim
556:30;VsCode_43645;Each Extension can create its own viewlet and there could be too many icons in the activity bar. This is mitigated by our activity bar that can scale.;Claim
556:31;VsCode_43645;User has no control to group or ungroup views. If two extensions contribute `git` related views under two different viewlets, then user cannot group them into one.

556:51;VsCode_43645;Not sure yet, we can brainstorm;Claim

556:54;VsCode_43645;it would be nice to keep it flexible.;Claim
556:55;VsCode_43645;as that is the terminology I've seen used for things on the activity bar;Premise
556:56;VsCode_43645;I could be totally wrong on this,;Claim
556:57;VsCode_43645;but presumably the image is used as mask so that the background color is actually determined by the theme? If not, the default light and dark themes both use a black activity bar so I'm not sure how the editor would decide which to use;Premise
556:58;VsCode_43645;If there isn't any activity API will there still be some way to apply a badge (counter) to the activity icon?;Non-Argument
556:59;VsCode_43645; If no callback function is registered, then fall back to some sensible default like addition (if view A reports 5 errors and view B reports 3 errors, the activity probably wants the number 8 in its badge). But since some activities might want semantics other than addition (say, the max or min of the numbers reported by subviews), allow an activity to register a callback function that takes a list of views and what they have in their badge (e.g., the number being displayed) and which will return what to display in the activity badge.;Premise
556:60;VsCode_43645;Why not let the activity register a callback function to decide?;Claim
556:61;VsCode_43645;VS Code won't be able to account for every scenario, but allowing a callback to be registered would give that control over to activity authors.;Claim
556:62;VsCode_43645;"So for example, an activity that's part of a profiler tool might (if arbitrary strings are allowed in badges) have one view with ""400 ms"" in its badge, another view with ""800 ms"" in its badge, and it might want to report ""1.2 s"" in the overall activity's badge";Premise
556:63;VsCode_43645;I already hide the view container if there are no views are registered. Hiding it when there are no views shown in the container might be problematic especially when user hides the view manually. To be deterministic, view containers are hidden only when no views are registered. `when` context is not provided;Claim

559:11;VsCode_45445;I expect matches inside the selected area to be highlighted.;Claim
559:12;VsCode_45445;With VS Code acting this way, it is faster to manually replace;Claim

559:17;VsCode_45445;Single-character searches are basically impossible, making converting between single- and double-quotes, as well as Find-and-Replace raves a bit of a nightmare.;Claim
559:18;VsCode_45445;I think the steps listed above work now.;Claim
559:19;VsCode_45445;Also, it's really hard to see if find in selection is turned on or not in the Dark (Visual Studio) theme.;Claim
559:20;VsCode_45445;I agree that the Dark (Visual Studio) theme makes it frustratingly hard to discern the state of the button;Claim

559:22;VsCode_45445;Also, I think this behaviour as a default would Do The Right Thing(TM) in the majority of cases:;Claim
559:23;VsCode_45445;"When find is activated (e.g. Ctrl+F), if current selection spans more than one line (i.e. selection includes one or more CRLF/LF), then automatically enable ""find in selection"".  Otherwise, use normal behaviour to put the current selection into the Find field.";Premise
559:24;VsCode_45445;"Of course, a tri-state user setting will definitely be welcome to force the behaviour to the classic behaviour, always using ""find in selection"" if there is any text selected, or the automatic behaviour.";Claim

559:30;VsCode_45445;Here is another unexpected behaviour:;Premise
559:31;VsCode_45445;Like I probably said before, it's faster for me to just CTRL-click to multi-select and manually change all instances than it is to fiddle with searching only in the selected area.;Claim
559:32;VsCode_45445;If I highlight an area, I probably want that area to stay selected until I unselect it.;Claim
559:33;VsCode_45445;I am interpretting the `find in selection` button as a function,;Claim
559:34;VsCode_45445;so when I press it, I want to see the matches in my highlighted area.;Premise
559:35;VsCode_45445;It's that simple;Claim
559:36;VsCode_45445;If I press the button and anything other than that happens, I get confused;Claim
559:37;VsCode_45445;because the state change is too complex to understand or memorize.;Premise

576:8;VsCode_70813;"This is about allowing extensions to add a button similar to this (""Open Workspace"") one:";Claim
576:9;VsCode_70813;![image;Premise
576:10;VsCode_70813;This sounds like a horrible idea to allow for extensions to do;Claim
576:11;VsCode_70813;because that basically opens the door for any extension to add a “Please donate” button into the editor.;Premise
576:12;VsCode_70813;Let me give more details why I think we should not do that:;Claim
576:13;VsCode_70813;"* We have no story for when multiple extensions contribute to the same editor* The action is not keyboard accessible* The button never went through a UX design, we just added it a long time ago but never revisited its UI (e.g. it competes clearly with the toolbar we already have for editors in the top right corner)* There is no way to turn off an extension from contributing UI pieces, so the more we allow to add, the more people might get annoyed by things an extension adds (yes, even if the extension is popular)";Premise
576:14;VsCode_70813;Here's is the alternative approach which I propose here;Claim
576:16;VsCode_70813;We closed this issue;Claim
576:17;VsCode_70813;because we don't plan to address it in the foreseeable future.;Premise
576:18;VsCode_70813;Another possibility might be to return diagnostics/squiggles and/or CodeActions/QuickFix results for that file.;Claim
576:19;VsCode_70813;our C/C++ team is working on using a webview UI front end over our c_cpp_properties.json config file, similar to the one used by the CodeLens extension, so you may want to consider something like that -- UPDATE: VS Code doesn't want us doing that so we're considering alternatives (improving/extending their existing UI?);Claim
576:20;VsCode_70813;I completely agree with @greazer that extensions can already abuse the system and be annoying. I also agree that the current button should go through a UX review and should be made accessible.;Claim
576:21;VsCode_70813;this should probably happen regardless of if you add the extensibility point.;Claim
576:22;VsCode_70813;"Perhaps the ask shouldn't be ""We want that specific button"",";Claim
576:23;VsCode_70813;"For launch.json files, the primary action is to add a configuration. For *.code-workspace files, the primary action is to open a workspace. In my scenario, I want to add a button called ""Add binding..."" to ""function.json"" files in the Azure Functions extension. That file is very specific to Azure Functions and users have been complaining that editing a json file is not intuitive. I can add to the toolbar or context menus, but I just don't think those entry points are discoverable enough. When I say ""primary action"" I'm guessing that over half the time a user would prefer to click our button rather than edit the file directly.";Premise
576:24;VsCode_70813;For example, our extension provides a custom tree view and VS Code lets users right click on that tree view to hide it.;Premise
576:25;VsCode_70813;Perhaps part of the proposal/discussion should be a way to hide the button (or whatever entry point is added);Claim
576:26;VsCode_70813;I don't see how this particular ask would be any more risky than many other extensibility point in VSCode.;Claim
576:27;VsCode_70813;I don't agree that this is a reason to not consider this proposal.;Claim
576:30;VsCode_70813;It needs to be reviewed and adjusted if it hasn't been already.;Claim
576:31;VsCode_70813;This problem has already existed for some time, and is likely not addressable without tyrannical control by VSCode itself.;Claim
576:32;VsCode_70813;I am no longer privy to exactly what the C++ team's needs are with regard to this specific request. However, the Python team is desperately looking for a way to allow users to be guided to edit a specific file type (sub-type to be more specific) that when saved and/or closed causes an event to occur in the extension that immediately drives further extension activity and potentially more user input. #65459. We've experimented with other vscode extension points and ideas, but have been unable to find a reasonable solution for our scenario. We're more than willing to do the coding to make any acceptable solution happen, but we want to be sure that the resulting PR will be approved.;Premise

593:10;VsCode_91629;Limit only applies when `before` isn't `true`. And if its a number, then you should only return that many items. If its a string, it should be treated as and ending cursor, so you should return all items between the cursor (if there is one) and the limit cursor.;Premise
593:11;VsCode_91629;I didn't want to introduce an `endCursor` or something like that,;Claim

596:6;VsCode_95819;For example, when looking at a long `git diff` that uses a pager. Because Page Down key is hijacked by VSCode, there's no way to pass it to the underlying shell session when using the Terminal.;Premise
596:7;VsCode_95819;The most feasible solution for that would be a new keybinding;Claim
596:8;VsCode_95819;Introduce keystroke action for each key, e.g. `workbench.action.terminal.sendKey.pageDown`, `...pageUp`, and so on, and allow us to bind any key (e.g. Ctrl+Shift+PageDown) to that action. Some reasonable defaults for Linux and Mac should be provided.;Claim
596:10;VsCode_95819;there is a setting `terminal.integrated.commandsToSkipShell` which is pre-populated with all terminal commands and a bunch of other ones that if the keystroke would activate one of those commands, it skips it.;Claim

596:16;VsCode_95819;I maintain [my keybindings as a template](https://gitlab.com/Nowaker/dotfiles-vscode/-/blob/master/keybindings.template.jsonc) where a script replaces `$CTRL` with `ctrl` or `cmd` based on target platform.;Claim

596:19;VsCode_95819;"No you can't use CtrlCmd, but you can accomplish the same thing using `""when"": ""isMac""` or `""when"": ""!isMac""`.";Claim
596:20;VsCode_95819;In the upcoming settings sync feature keybindings will be platform specific by default so you could probably retire your old system.;Claim
596:21;VsCode_95819;I prefer to maintain a platform agnostic setup keybindings fil;Claim
596:22;VsCode_95819;I'll stay with my $CTRL approach for less code duplication and consistent generation.;Claim
596:24;VsCode_95819;I doubt it would happen, as the `is<Platform>` keys accomplish a similar thing. Also most people edit keybindings via the UI now so I'd expect most improvements to work well there as well.;Claim
