310:14;Atom_3064;"""Open Folder"" is usually what I want on linux,";Claim: Hypothesis/ Opinion
310:15;Atom_3064;The shortcut keymapping can actually be configured via the `~/.atom/keymap.cson` and if you do add an (redundant) entry, it will make the shortcut appear in the menu:;Claim: Hypothesis/ Opinion
310:16;Atom_3064;I'd be up for changing `ctrl-shift-O` to be the actual Open Folder command, do you know any other apps that follow this behavior for opening files vs. folders?;Claim: Hypothesis/ Opinion
310:17;Atom_3064;I think `Ctrl` is a good leading modifier key.;Claim: Hypothesis/ Opinion
310:18;Atom_3064;`O` seems intuitive;Claim: Probability/doubtfulness
310:19;Atom_3064;the obvious choice would be `Alt`: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd> to open a folder.;Claim: Suggestion/ recommendation
310:20;Atom_3064;As far as I can see, there is no such binding in Atom or the bundled packages.;Claim: Hypothesis/ Opinion
310:21;Atom_3064;I do also advocate for changing the `Ctrl-Shift-O` keybinding: While on Apple keyboards the `Alt` and `Cmd` keys are swapped, making them almost equivalently prominent, on PC keyboards `Ctrl` and `Shift` are considerably nearer together than `Ctrl` and `Alt`, making it harder to press them at the same time.;Claim: Assertion
310:22;Atom_3064;"This means that the keybinding to open an (Atom or Atom package) developer feature would be more prominent than an end user (not necessarily a developer) feature. I think at that point developer friendliness is overdone.Here are some examples of `Ctrl+Shift` in end user functionality:- In many editors with history support";Claim: Hypothesis/ Opinion
310:23;Atom_3064;"`Ctrl+O` opens a file while `Ctrl+Alt+O` opens the folder the currently opened files is stored in. In Brackets, `Ctrl-Alt-O` opens the QuickOpen (like Atom's FuzzyFinder), which is probably more frequently used and displaced opening the folder of the current file.Overall `Ctrl-Shift-O` seems to be an unusual key binding for opening something";Claim: Hypothesis/ Opinion
310:24;Atom_3064;. I could imagine that the cause for this is that few programs actually have a concept of a folder/directory _and also_ a concept of a file. Many text editors only know single files and IDEs usually have a concept of a project which leads to not having a concept of a file without a project anymore. For example, Eclipse can not even open a file without a project, for sublime every opened file is implicitely an opened project.;Claim: Hypothesis/ Opinion
310:25;Atom_3064;However we shouldn't think as other text editors. If it's useful and users create that keybind anyway, then it should be a keybind by default.;Claim: Suggestion/ recommendation
310:26;Atom_3064;I think `ctrl-shift-o` should open a folder, `open-dev` is an advanced feature and we've tried in the past to not reserve common keybindings for advanced features.;Claim: Hypothesis/ Opinion
310:27;Atom_3064;Running `open-dev` was really common in the early days of Atom development;Claim: Assertion
310:28;Atom_3064;But for the most part, people aren't doing this, except when developing packages or core, in which case using `ctrl-alt-o` on Linux to open a dev window is just as easy I believe, and of course these can always be remapped locally.;Claim: Hypothesis/ Opinion
310:29;Atom_3064;`ctrl-shift-O` is currently bound to `application:open-dev` on Linux, so although it prompts for a folder, it isn't the standard Open Folder action, it opens a new window in dev mode to the selected folder. Dev mode windows are primarily used for developing packages or Atom core;Claim: Assertion

If you do shift+up then cmd+l, the beginning of the first line is selected, but not the end of the last line. So, what seems to be going on is that cmd+l is adding the line containing the cursor to the selection, instead of adding all lines containing selected text to the selection.Weirdly, if you click and drag from midway through a line to midway through the line above then cmd+l, it selects all of the upper line but deselects the lower line entirely.";Claim: Assertion

We placed run kernel, interrupt kernel, and restart kernel in one section. Cut cells, copy cells, and paste cells are placed in another section.We moved the kernel functions (run kernel, intterupt kernel, etc.) to after the add new cell icon because they will be used more often than the cut, copy, paste icons. We placed them closer to the left because of their higher importance.During our user tests of we noticed that when multiple users would try to change kernels, they would click the top right kernel label in the toolbar multiple times because they thought it was a dropdown. We decided to change it to actually be a dropdown where you can change kernels.We also want to add an indicator of when the file has been saved";Claim: Assertion

507:21;Jupyter_Lab_6768;your solution worked, but clicking is quite cumbersome;Claim: Assertion
507:22;Jupyter_Lab_6768;maybe there should be a way to map browser search to Ctrl+F and custom search to something else;Claim: Probability/doubtfulness
507:23;Jupyter_Lab_6768;An alternative to *clicking* the top menu bar is to open up the command pallet (Ctrl+Shift+C) and then Ctrl+F;Claim: Assertion

507:29;Jupyter_Lab_6768;Similar to the regexp option today, I imagine there would be options for searching in all, input, or output. Obviously, replace won't work for output;Claim: Hypothesis/ Opinion

507:32;Jupyter_Lab_6768;Searching all output is significantly harder than searching input,;Claim: Assertion
507:34;Jupyter_Lab_6768;I quickly tried something [based on this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/10730777/3745694) and it seems to mostly work.;Claim: Probability/doubtfulness
507:35;Jupyter_Lab_6768;In my experience, working directly with the rendered DOM is really difficult when you have all sorts of other frameworks messing with it (React and Phosphor).;Claim: Hypothesis/ Opinion
507:36;Jupyter_Lab_6768;I tried to do something like this in the classic notebook, finding the nodes containing matches, inserting a `span` around the match, applying a class to the `span`, and keeping track of them so that I could clean up later.;Claim: Hypothesis/ Opinion
507:37;Jupyter_Lab_6768;I do think this could be a good place to start for most basic output types, especially those that aren't interactive and especially if you limit this sort of DOM search to the outputs.  I haven't tried anything like this yet in JupyterLab with the new documentsearch framework,;Claim: Hypothesis/ Opinion
507:38;Jupyter_Lab_6768;I'm not sure what sort of model-like information might be available about cell output;Claim: Probability/doubtfulness
507:39;Jupyter_Lab_6768;This is the approach that I initially envisioned taking once we got around to cell outputs, maybe due to some bitter memories of DOM-based search on the classic notebook;Claim: Probability/doubtfulness
507:40;Jupyter_Lab_6768;This may be hard.;Claim: Probability/doubtfulness
507:41;Jupyter_Lab_6768;I believe its at least worth trying to do something here - even if we can't solve every case.;Claim: Hypothesis/ Opinion
507:42;Jupyter_Lab_6768;it will hurt novice users.;Claim: Probability/doubtfulness
507:44;Jupyter_Lab_6768;I agree, it'll likely be difficult.  I don't know enough about how outputs are rendered to know where in that process this sort of logic might belong, but I think having something that works *with* the rendering step rather than on top of it or after the fact might be more robust and flexible for the myriad different output types that exist now and in the future;Claim: Hypothesis/ Opinion
507:45;Jupyter_Lab_6768;If search was built directly into how things are rendered, it'd make it easier to integrate different forms of output in the future.;Claim: Suggestion/ recommendation
507:46;Jupyter_Lab_6768;And yeah I totally agree, searching only inputs is not ideal.  We absolutely do want to search the outputs.;Claim: Hypothesis/ Opinion

507:49;Jupyter_Lab_6768;We kind of punted on searching the outputs;Claim: Assertion

507:54;Jupyter_Lab_6768;I agree that we should allow renders to be allowed to have some ability to implement search. ;Claim: Hypothesis/ Opinion
507:56;Jupyter_Lab_6768;Still, by default, it would be good to implement anything that searched the DOM for text.;Claim: Suggestion/ recommendation
507:57;Jupyter_Lab_6768;Even if something like: `<span class='bar'>hello </span> world` cannot find `hello world`, having some search text would be a big step forward.;Claim: Suggestion/ recommendation
507:58;Jupyter_Lab_6768;Personally I think this issue is critical enough that we should consider disabling the Jupyterlab-specific search by default;Claim: Hypothesis/ Opinion

514:10;Jupyter_Lab_7983;That is correct;Claim: Assertion
514:12;Jupyter_Lab_7983;In this setup, it’s extremely likely that the two providers will send the same completions to the completions list. Without visual differentiation and de-duping, this could give off the impression that completions are buggy.;Claim: Probability/doubtfulness
514:13;Jupyter_Lab_7983;Even with de-duping, adding a visual indicator would give users more insight into the value add of their chosen extensions.

537:36;VsCode_14638;I can't speak for others and I suspect I'm not in a majority, but I feel like a setting for that would be warranted regardless of whether the recycle bin exists (or is enabled) or not.;Claim: Hypothesis/ Opinion

556:16;VsCode_43645;There will be only single icon and will be masked to be aligned with existing icons.;Claim: Hypothesis/ Opinion
556:19;VsCode_43645;There is a thinking to expose badge in view API. Have to think how badges from multiple views escalate to the activity;Claim: Hypothesis/ Opinion
556:24;VsCode_43645;Also, when I call `reveal` on my tree, the sidebar switches back to Explorer, rather than the where the tree is in its new place.;Claim: Hypothesis/ Opinion
556:27;VsCode_43645;"Will these contributed views automatically be listed in the command palette?I don't use the activity bar at all.  I navigate everything through the command palette.Also, when I refer to the command palette, I want them in the normal command list.  Just like `view: show SCM` etc.  I don't want to have to type `view ...` to get to the view as that requires a separate action and does not get listed in the recent list of commands I've used.";Claim: Hypothesis/ Opinion
556:29;VsCode_43645;Extension can group the views they would like to have under single viewlet. This will work well with azure views.;Claim: Suggestion/ recommendation
556:30;VsCode_43645;Each Extension can create its own viewlet and there could be too many icons in the activity bar. This is mitigated by our activity bar that can scale.;Claim: Probability/doubtfulness
556:31;VsCode_43645;User has no control to group or ungroup views. If two extensions contribute `git` related views under two different viewlets, then user cannot group them into one. If an extension contribute `azure` and `docker` views under single viewlet and then it is not possible for user to make `docker` as a separate viewlet.;Claim: Probability/doubtfulness
556:32;VsCode_43645;Ability to move views across `groups` . This is a big discussion scopes to complete VS Code.;Claim: Assertion

556:51;VsCode_43645;Not sure yet, we can brainstorm;Claim: Probability/doubtfulness
556:52;VsCode_43645;Also the name `activities` makes sense to me;Claim: Assertion

556:54;VsCode_43645;it would be nice to keep it flexible.;Claim: Suggestion/ recommendation
556:56;VsCode_43645;I could be totally wrong on this,;Claim: Probability/doubtfulness
556:60;VsCode_43645;Why not let the activity register a callback function to decide?;Claim: Hypothesis/ Opinion
556:61;VsCode_43645;VS Code won't be able to account for every scenario, but allowing a callback to be registered would give that control over to activity authors.;Claim: Probability/doubtfulness
556:63;VsCode_43645;I already hide the view container if there are no views are registered. Hiding it when there are no views shown in the container might be problematic especially when user hides the view manually. To be deterministic, view containers are hidden only when no views are registered. `when` context is not provided;Claim: Assertion
556:66;VsCode_43645;I tried putting in our existing Icon in (I hoped to just use the same SVG we use for icons in the tree, etc.) but it's got less padding also also looks a different colour:;Claim: Assertion

556:74;VsCode_43645;As for hiding the activity if there are no visible views, here are 2 scenarios I'm looking at solving.;Claim: Probability/doubtfulness
556:75;VsCode_43645;I would like to provide an option to the user to choose whether to show the GitLens explorers in the `scm` activity OR in its own `gitlens` activity.;Claim: Hypothesis/ Opinion
556:76;VsCode_43645;And as far as I can tell, this isn't possible,;Claim: Probability/doubtfulness
556:78;VsCode_43645;I would like to have the activity hide as I am currently hiding the view itself, to keep the UI cleaner;Claim: Hypothesis/ Opinion
556:79;VsCode_43645;Will do! I think the colour difference I noted was;Claim: Hypothesis/ Opinion
556:81;VsCode_43645;It might not be a big deal;Claim: Probability/doubtfulness

556:88;VsCode_43645;One thing to keep in mind is viewlet progress.;Claim: Assertion
556:90;VsCode_43645;Changed the extension point name to `viewsContainer`;Claim: Assertion
557:2;VsCode_43750;The current workaround is to manually switch VS Code to the High Contrast Theme via `File > Preferences > Color Theme > High Contrast;Claim: Assertion

557:12;VsCode_43750;it looks like you removed that code that handles high contrast on Windows and never added it back to the renderer;Claim: Probability/doubtfulness
557:13;VsCode_43750;I created https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/44176 to prefer the HC theme if we detect high contrast mode. It is a bit ugly though;Claim: Assertion

559:18;VsCode_45445;I think the steps listed above work now.;Claim: Hypothesis/ Opinion
559:19;VsCode_45445;Also, it's really hard to see if find in selection is turned on or not in the Dark (Visual Studio) theme.;Claim: Hypothesis/ Opinion
559:20;VsCode_45445;I agree that the Dark (Visual Studio) theme makes it frustratingly hard to discern the state of the button;Claim: Hypothesis/ Opinion

559:31;VsCode_45445;Like I probably said before, it's faster for me to just CTRL-click to multi-select and manually change all instances than it is to fiddle with searching only in the selected area.;Claim: Hypothesis/ Opinion

576:20;VsCode_70813;I completely agree with @greazer that extensions can already abuse the system and be annoying. I also agree that the current button should go through a UX review and should be made accessible.;Claim: Hypothesis/ Opinion
